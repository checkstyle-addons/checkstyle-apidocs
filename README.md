# Historical Checkstyle Javadoc

This repository hosts a few selected versions of historical Javadoc of the
[Checkstyle](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle) project.

They basically have documentation of past versions on sourceforge.io, but those are not reliably available. Especially
the Javadoc has been down a lot. So we re-host it here to the extent that we reference it from our own old
documentation, under the same license as Checkstyle.

Current versions available:

- [v6.16.1](https://checkstyle-addons.github.io/checkstyle-apidocs/v6.16.1/)
- [v8.0](https://checkstyle-addons.github.io/checkstyle-apidocs/v8.0/)
- [v8.21](https://checkstyle-addons.github.io/checkstyle-apidocs/v8.21/)
